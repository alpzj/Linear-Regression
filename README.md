## Predicting House Prices

One of the applications of ML is predicting house prices, a task that involves a combination of data understanding, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation. In this project, we'll walk through each step, making sure everything is crystal clear.
Here are the steps that will be followed in the project -

1. Understanding the Data:
The first and foremost step in any ML project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. In our case, we'll discuss where the data is sourced from and why it's suitable for predicting house prices. Understanding the features (variables) in the dataset is crucial for later stages, such as feature engineering.

2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline:
Once we have a grasp of our data, the next step is to create a robust data preprocessing pipeline. This involves handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and encoding categorical variables. A well-structured pipeline ensures consistency and efficiency throughout the project.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is a crucial phase where we explore the dataset visually and statistically to extract insights. We'll identify patterns, correlations, and potential outliers in the data. EDA allows us to make informed decisions about which features to include in our model and how to handle any remaining issues.

4. Feature Engineering:
Based on the findings from EDA, we may need to perform feature engineering to create new variables or modify existing ones. This step aims to enhance the predictive power of our model by providing it with more relevant information.

5. Model Development - Linear Regression:
Linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, will be our chosen model for predicting house prices. The project will discuss the principles behind linear regression and how it is suitable for housing price prediction task.

6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the model's performance is essential to ensure its effectiveness in making predictions. We'll explore metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess how well our model is performing on the given dataset.

7. Training and Prediction:
With a well-evaluated model, we move on to training it on our dataset. It will cover the training process and then use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
